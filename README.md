#### ⚠️ Note
We are still working on this project so the releases are not perfect and you may encounter issues or bugs while using it :)   
👇🏼 If you are interested in the extern libraries we used it's just down below

### External Libraries :   
We first used [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) :
> It provided us a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.   

We then imported [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) :
> GLEW helped us loading and managing OpenGL the "easy" way. It's in some way a portal between us and OpenGL, and it makes OpenGL convenient to use for us.
> GLM is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphic software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications. It provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same naming conventions and functionality than GLSL.

Considering the problems we got while trying to import images and textures ourselves with a "homemade" program... we imported [stbImage](https://github.com/nothings/stb) :
